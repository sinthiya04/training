Acts 22:1-\n6
[22 1 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”, 22 , 2 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet., Then Paul said:, 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today., 4 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,, 5 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished., 6 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.]

Acts 9:1-\n0
[Saul’s Conversion, 9 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest, 9 , 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem., 3 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him., 4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”, 5 “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked., “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied., “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”, 6 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”, 6 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”, 7 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone., 8 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus., 9 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything., 10 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!”, “Ananias!”, “Yes, Lord,” he answered., 11 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying., “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying., 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”, 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”, 13 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem., 14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”, 15 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel., “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel., 16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”, 16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”, 17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”, 18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,, 19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength., Saul in Damascus and Jerusalem, Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus., 20 At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.]
Acts 9:22-\n8
[22 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah., 23 After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,, 24 but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him., 25 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall., 26 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple., 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus., 28 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.]

Galatians 1:11-\n7
[Paul Called by God, 11 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin., 12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ., 13 For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it., 14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers., 15 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased, 16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being., 17 I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.]
Acts 11:25-\n0
[25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,, 26 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch., 27 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch., 28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.), 29 The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea., 30 This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.]

[Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas, 36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”, 37 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,, 38 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work., 39 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,]
Acts 16:1-\n0
[Timothy Joins Paul and Silas, 16 Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek., 16 , 2 The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him., 3 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek., 4 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey., 5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers., Paul’s Vision of the Man of Macedonia, 6 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia., 7 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to., 8 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas., 9 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”, 10 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them., Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi, 11 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis., 12 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days., 13 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there., 14 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message., 15 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us., Paul and Silas in Prison, 16 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling., 17 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”, 18 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her., 19 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities., 20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar, 21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”, 22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods., 23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully., 24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks., 25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them., 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose., 27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped., 28 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”, 29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas., 30 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”, 31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”, 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house., 33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized., 34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household., 35 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.”, 36 The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”, 37 But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”, 38 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed., 39 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city., 40 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left., The text and meaning of the Greek for the leading city of that district are uncertain.]
Acts 18:23-\n8
[23 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples., 24 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures., 25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John., 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately., 27 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed., 28 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah., Or with fervor in the Spirit]

[Paul Preaches at Rome Under Guard, 17 Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans., 18 They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death., 19 The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people., 20 For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”, 21 They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you., 22 But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.”, 23 They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus., 24 Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe., 25 They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:, 26 “‘Go to this people and say,, “You will be ever hearing but never understanding;,     you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”,     , you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”, 27 For this people’s heart has become calloused;,     they hardly hear with their ears,,     , they hardly hear with their ears,,     and they have closed their eyes.,     , and they have closed their eyes., Otherwise they might see with their eyes,,     hear with their ears,,     , hear with their ears,,     understand with their hearts,     , understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.’, 28 “Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”, [29] , 30 For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him., 31 He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance!, Isaiah 6:9,\n0 (see Septuagint), Some manuscripts include here After he said this, the Jews left, arguing vigorously among themselves.]

[Timothy Joins Paul and Silas, 16 Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek., 16 , 2 The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him., 3 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek., 4 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey., 5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers., Paul’s Vision of the Man of Macedonia, 6 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia., 7 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to., 8 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas., 9 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”, 10 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them., Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi, 11 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis., 12 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days., 13 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there., 14 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message., 15 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us., Paul and Silas in Prison, 16 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling., 17 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”, 18 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her., 19 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities., 20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar, 21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”, 22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods., 23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully., 24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks., 25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them., 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose., 27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped., 28 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”, 29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas., 30 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”, 31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”, 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house., 33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized., 34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household., 35 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.”, 36 The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”, 37 But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”, 38 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed., 39 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city., 40 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left., The text and meaning of the Greek for the leading city of that district are uncertain.]
Acts 18:23-\n8
[23 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples., 24 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures., 25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John., 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately., 27 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed., 28 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah., Or with fervor in the Spirit]

[Saul’s Conversion, 9 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples.

Acts 22:5-\n1
[5 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished., 6 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me., 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’, 8 “‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked., “ ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ he replied., ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’, 9 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me., 10 “‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked., “ ‘Get up,’ the Lord said, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’, ‘Get up,’, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’, 11 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me., 12 “A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there., 13 He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him., 14 “Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth., 15 You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard., 16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’, 17 “When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance, 18 and saw the Lord speaking to me. ‘Quick!’ he said. ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’, ‘Quick!’, ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’, 19 “‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you., 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’, 21 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ , Or witness]

Acts 9:22-\n8
[22 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah., 23 After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,, 24 but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him., 25 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall., 26 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple., 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus., 28 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.]

[Paul Called by God, 11 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin., 12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ., 13 For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it., 14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers., 15 But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased, 16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being., 17 I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.]

[25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,, 26 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch., 27 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch., 28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world.

Acts 13:14-\n2
[14 From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down., 15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.”, 16 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!, 17 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country;, 18 for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness;, 19 and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance., 20 All this took about \n0 years., “After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet., 21 Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years., 22 After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’, 23 “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised., 24 Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel., 25 As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’, 26 “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent., 27 The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath., 28 Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed., 29 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb., 30 But God raised him from the dead,, 31 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people., 32 “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors, 33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:, “‘You are my son;,     today I have become your father.’,     , today I have become your father.’, 34 God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said,, “‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’, 35 So it is also stated elsewhere:, “‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’, 36 “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed., 37 But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay., 38 “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you., 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses., 40 Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:, 41 “‘Look, you scoffers,,     wonder and perish,,     , wonder and perish,, for I am going to do something in your days,     that you would never believe,,     , that you would never believe,,     even if someone told you.’”,     , even if someone told you.’”, 42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath., 43 When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God., 44 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord., 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him., 46 Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles., 47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us:, “‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,,     that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”,     , that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”, 48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed., 49 The word of the Lord spread through the whole region., 50 But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region., 51 So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium., 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit., Some manuscripts he cared for them, Psalm 2:7, Isaiah 55:3, Psalm 16:\n0 (see Septuagint), Hab. 1:5, The Greek is singular., The Greek is singular., Isaiah 49:6]

[In Iconium, 14 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed., 14 , 2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers., 3 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders., 4 The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles., 5 There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them., 6 But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,, 7 where they continued to preach the gospel., In Lystra and Derbe, 8 In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked., 9 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed, 10 and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk., 11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”, 12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker., 13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them., 14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:, 15 “Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them., 16 In the past, he let all nations go their own way., 17 Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”, 18 Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them., 19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead., 20 But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.]

Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,]

The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God., 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith., 9 Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,, 10 “You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?, 11 Now the hand of the Lord is against you.
