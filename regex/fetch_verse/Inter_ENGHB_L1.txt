Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?, 13 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go., 14 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you., 15 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead.

And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”, 5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died.

Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”, 10 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband., 11 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events., The Apostles Heal Many, 12 The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people.

I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was., 6 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds., 7 Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’, 8 “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’, 9 “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’, 10 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again., 11 “Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying., 12 The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house., 13 He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter., 14 He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’, 15 “As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning., 16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’, 17 So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”, 18 When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”, Or in, Or in]

Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?, 13 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go., 14 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you., 15 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead.
